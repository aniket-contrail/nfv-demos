Scripts to set up NFV Demos on Contrail

This script relies on another script which is a wrapper to the Contrail VNC API. 
That wrapper script can be found here:
https://github.com/tonyliu0592/orch/blob/master/config.py

We use the wrapper script to create the building blocks of the NFV demos and orchestrate the demo topology.
